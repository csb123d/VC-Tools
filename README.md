# VC Analyst NLP Tool

## Overview

The **VC Analyst NLP Tool** is a Python-based application designed to help venture capital (VC) analysts manage the overwhelming amount of unstructured data they encounter. This tool uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to collect, analyze, and categorize data from multiple sources such as news articles, blogs, and reports, enabling faster, data-driven decision-making.

### Key Features:
- **Automated Web Scraping**: Collect data from news articles, company websites, and other sources using BeautifulSoup and NewsAPI.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identify key entities such as companies, people, and industry sectors from unstructured text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Gauge the overall sentiment of articles and social media posts about specific companies or sectors.
- **Relevance Ranking**: Automatically rank data based on relevance to your portfolio or interest areas.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize trends, sentiments, and key insights with an easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit.
- **Automated Reports**: Generate PDF reports summarizing key insights, risks, and opportunities.

## Motivation

Venture capital analysts are constantly inundated with data from multiple unstructured sources, making it difficult to track industry trends, potential risks, and competitor activity. This project aims to automate parts of that workflow, allowing analysts to focus on high-level decision-making by providing tools that handle the data collection and processing in the background.
